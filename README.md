Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are one of the most innovative ideas proposed in this
decade. At its core, GANs are an unsupervised model for generating new elements from a set of
similar elements. For instance, to produce original face pictures given a collection of face images or
create new tunes out of preexisting melodies. GANs have found applications for image, text, and
sound generation, being at the core of technologies such as AI music, deep fakes, and content-aware
image editing. Besides pure generation, GANs have also been applied to transforming images from
one domain to another and as a means for style transfer. To add one more application, they fit
as an intelligent data augmentation technique for semi-supervised learning.A GAN, or Generative
Adversarial Network, is a generative model that simultaneously trains two models: a generative
model that captures the data distribution, and a discriminative model that estimates the proba-
bility that a sample came from the training data rather than generative model.
